## 2. Functional Component Description

### 2.1 Implementation Core (earthaware/)
The primary directory for model development, dataset processing, and local API serving. Contains the Spectral Attention Module and the integrated Vision-Language alignment logic.

### 2.2 Web Application (geo-research-assistant/)
A decoupled full-stack system providing a geospatial research environment. Features include 3D map selection, multisensor image upload, and real-time AI analysis.

### 2.3 Cloud Demo (hf-spaces-demo/)
An optimized package containing the Streamlit application for public evaluation. Features a mock inference engine for demonstration of spectral index analysis.
